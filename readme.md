## Restaurant App

This is a simple application where users can upload their favourite restaurants. They can:
- tag them
- rate them
- add location data for them
- add comments regarding their experiences

Restaurants are then fully CRUD'able, search-able and sort-able via tags.

# How to set it up
- clone the repo
- configure environment variables (see `example_variables.env` for template)
- npm install
- npm start

#### Ensure you have mongodb up and running!
